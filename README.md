These visualizations collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of attrition causes, enabling HR to develop targeted strategies for retention and workforce management
In this HR Analytics project, we analyzed employee data with columns encompassing employee demographics, job details, satisfaction levels, and more. Using Power BI, we visualized key insights such as attrition rates, salary distribution, and job satisfaction. Our analysis revealed patterns related to employee turnover, performance, and work-life balance. We categorized employees into salary slabs and age groups to better understand our workforce. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to support data-driven decision-making in HR, ultimately enhancing employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention within the organization
